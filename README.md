This app would allow you to create a linear model based by selecting all or a few points in the plot displayed.

Also, you could manipulate the axis to zoom in or out in the plot and have a vetter visualization of your arrea of interest.

The axis controls are the two slidebars labeled as "Max and min X values" and "Max and min Y values".

You could show and hide the axis labels by checking/unchecking the boxes labeled as "Show/Hide X axis label" and "Show/Hide X axis label".

Enjoy the app.
